    Due
        Sunday 8th August at 11.59pm.

    Description
        Computers use what we call “parity” to check if data has become corrupt. Put simply, they check for odd or even numbers of bits, to determine if the data is still intact. Your task is to write a Python program that simulates this idea.

    Submission Requirements:
        A text file containing a link to your project repository.
        Include a screenshot of your code passing all of the tests in Terminal/Powershell.
